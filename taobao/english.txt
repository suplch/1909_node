Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine or Python's Twisted.
Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library.
In other systems there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop.
Typically behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script and at the end starts a server through a blocking call like EventMachine::run().
In Node.js there is no such start-the-event-loop call.
Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform.
This behavior is like browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user.
